# Welcome

## Starting app

To start the application, run `make up` on the root of the project.

## Verify

After the app is up, you will receieve a message like this:

```sh
app    | db connected
app    |
app    |    ____    __
app    |   / __/___/ /  ___
app    |  / _// __/ _ \/ _ \
app    | /___/\__/_//_/\___/ v4.10.2
app    | High performance, minimalist Go web framework
app    | https://echo.labstack.com
app    | ____________________________________O/_______
app    |                                     O\
app    | â‡¨ http server started on 192.168.208.3:8080
```

The IP showed above is the IP from the app.
The IP for the DB is the same as the app, but the last digit is `2` instead of `3`. On the example above, the IP for the DB would be `192.168.208.2`.
